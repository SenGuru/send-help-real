# ✅ Multi-Tenant Backend Complete!

## **What's Fixed:**

### **✅ Database Schema (Multi-Tenant)**
- All models now have `businessId` foreign key
- Unique constraints are per-business (not global)
- Complete data isolation between businesses

### **✅ API Controllers (Business-Specific)**
- All controllers filter by `req.admin.businessId`
- Admins can only see/modify their business data
- Cross-business data access prevented

### **✅ Authentication (Business-Aware)**
- JWT tokens include `businessId`
- Admin login returns business information
- Business creation during admin setup

### **✅ Public API (For Flutter App)**
- `/api/public/business/:businessCode` - Get business-specific data
- Returns colors, rankings, coupons for specific business
- No authentication required (public endpoint)

## **How It Works Now:**

### **Admin Flow:**
1. Admin creates account with business name
2. Gets JWT token with their `businessId`
3. Can only manage their business colors/rankings/coupons
4. Complete isolation from other businesses

### **Flutter App Flow:**
1. User enters business code (or scans QR code)
2. App calls `/api/public/business/{code}`
3. Gets business-specific theme colors
4. Gets business-specific rankings ("Explorer/Champion" vs "Bronze/Gold")
5. Gets business-specific coupons

## **Example API Responses:**

### **Business A (Coffee Shop):**
```json
{
  "business": { "name": "Joe's Coffee" },
  "theme": {
    "primary": "#8B4513",
    "secondary": "#DEB887"
  },
  "rankings": [
    { "title": "Coffee Newbie", "pointsRequired": 0 },
    { "title": "Caffeine Lover", "pointsRequired": 500 },
    { "title": "Espresso Expert", "pointsRequired": 1000 }
  ],
  "coupons": [
    { "code": "FREECOFFEE", "discountValue": 100 }
  ]
}
```

### **Business B (Gym):**
```json
{
  "business": { "name": "FitLife Gym" },
  "theme": {
    "primary": "#FF4500",
    "secondary": "#000000"
  },
  "rankings": [
    { "title": "Beginner", "pointsRequired": 0 },
    { "title": "Fitness Enthusiast", "pointsRequired": 500 },
    { "title": "Gym Warrior", "pointsRequired": 1000 }
  ],
  "coupons": [
    { "code": "NEWMEMBER", "discountValue": 20 }
  ]
}
```

## **Next Steps:**

### **Flutter App Updates Needed:**
1. **Add business code input screen**
2. **Store business data locally**
3. **Update theme system to use API colors**
4. **Update rankings to use API data**
5. **Update coupons to use API data**

### **Flutter Code Changes:**
```dart
// 1. Business Code Input
class BusinessCodeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // User enters business code or scans QR
}

// 2. API Service
class BusinessService {
  static Future<BusinessData> getBusinessData(String code) async {
    final response = await http.get('/api/public/business/$code');
    return BusinessData.fromJson(response.data);
  }
}

// 3. Update main.dart to use API colors
class LoyaltyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder<BusinessData>(
      future: BusinessService.getBusinessData(storedBusinessCode),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.hasData) {
          return MaterialApp(
            theme: ThemeData(
              primaryColor: Color(snapshot.data.theme.primary),
              // Use API colors instead of hardcoded
            ),
          );
        }
        return BusinessCodeScreen();
      },
    );
  }
}
```

## **Admin Panel Features:**

### **✅ Color Control (Per Business)**
- Each business can set unique app colors
- Changes reflect immediately in their Flutter app

### **✅ Custom Rankings (Per Business)**
- Business A: "Bronze/Silver/Gold"
- Business B: "Explorer/Champion/Elite" 
- Business C: "Newbie/Pro/Expert"

### **✅ Coupon Management (Per Business)**
- Each business manages their own coupon codes
- No conflicts between businesses

## **Testing the Multi-Tenant System:**

### **Create Multiple Businesses:**
```bash
# Business 1
POST /api/auth/setup
{
  "email": "coffee@business.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "businessName": "Joe's Coffee",
  "firstName": "Joe",
  "lastName": "Smith"
}

# Business 2  
POST /api/auth/setup
{
  "email": "gym@business.com", 
  "password": "password123",
  "businessName": "FitLife Gym",
  "firstName": "Sarah",
  "lastName": "Johnson"
}
```

### **Test Data Isolation:**
1. Login as Business 1 admin
2. Create custom rankings ("Coffee Newbie", "Caffeine Lover")
3. Login as Business 2 admin  
4. Should see empty rankings (not Business 1's data)
5. Create different rankings ("Beginner", "Fitness Pro")

### **Test Flutter App:**
1. Call `/api/public/business/1` → Get Coffee Shop data
2. Call `/api/public/business/2` → Get Gym data
3. Each returns completely different colors/rankings/coupons
