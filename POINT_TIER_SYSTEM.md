# Business Point Tier System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
This implementation creates a separate business-specific point tier system that is completely independent from the existing XP/ranking system. Each business can configure up to 4 custom tiers with their own point requirements and rewards.

## System Architecture

### ðŸ”„ Two Separate Systems
1. **XP/Ranking System (Existing)**: 
   - Global app feature for user rankings
   - Uses `totalPoints`, `availablePoints`, `lifetimePoints` in User model
   - Uses `Ranking` model for tier definitions
   - Used across all businesses for leaderboards and competition

2. **Point Tier System (New)**:
   - Business-specific loyalty tiers  
   - Uses `tierPoints`, `lifetimeTierPoints` in separate UserPointTier model
   - Uses `PointTier` model for tier definitions
   - Each business configures their own tiers and rewards

## Database Schema

### New Tables Created

#### `point_tiers` Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- business_id (Foreign Key to business)
- tier_level (1-4, unique per business)
- name (Tier name, e.g., "Bronze Member")
- points_required (Points needed to achieve this tier)
- description (Optional tier description)
- rewards (JSONB array of reward objects)
- color (Hex color for UI display)
- icon_url (Optional tier icon)
- is_active (Boolean flag)
- sort_order (Display order)
```

#### `user_point_tiers` Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- business_id (Foreign Key to business)
- user_id (Foreign Key to users)
- current_tier_id (Foreign Key to point_tiers)
- tier_points (Current tier points balance)
- lifetime_tier_points (Total tier points ever earned)
- last_tier_update (Timestamp of last tier change)
- tier_history (JSONB array of tier achievement history)
```

## Backend API Implementation

### New Models
- **PointTier.js**: Manages tier definitions per business
- **UserPointTier.js**: Tracks user progress in point tiers

### New Controllers  
- **pointTierController.js**: CRUD operations for tier management

### New Routes
- `GET /api/point-tiers` - Get all tiers for business
- `POST /api/point-tiers` - Create/update tier
- `DELETE /api/point-tiers/:tierLevel` - Delete tier
- `GET /api/point-tiers/stats` - Get tier distribution statistics
- `POST /api/point-tiers/award-points` - Award tier points to user
- `GET /api/point-tiers/user/:userId` - Get user tier progress
- `POST /api/point-tiers/recalculate` - Recalculate all user tiers

### Enhanced Public API
- Updated `/api/public/business/:businessCode` to include `pointTiers` array

## Web Admin Interface

### New Point Tiers Page (`PointTiersPage.tsx`)

- **Bulk Operations**: Recalculate all user tiers

### Navigation Integration

## Mobile App Integration

### Enhanced Models

- **TierReward**: Represents individual rewards
- **BusinessResponse**: Updated to include `pointTiers` array

### New Point Tiers Page (`point_tiers_page.dart`)
