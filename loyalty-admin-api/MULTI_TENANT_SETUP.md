# Multi-Tenant Configuration Fix

## ✅ CONFIRMED: You're absolutely right!

The current backend is configured as **single-tenant** but should be **multi-tenant**.

## What This Means:

### ❌ Current (Wrong):
- One global set of colors for ALL businesses
- One global set of rankings for ALL businesses  
- One global set of coupons for ALL businesses
- Business A sees Business B's data

### ✅ Required (Fixed):
- Each business has UNIQUE colors, rankings, coupons
- Business A admin only sees Business A data
- Business B admin only sees Business B data
- Complete data isolation

## Database Schema Changes Made:

### 1. Added `businessId` to all models:
- `themes` table: `business_id` foreign key
- `rankings` table: `business_id` foreign key  
- `coupons` table: `business_id` foreign key
- `admins` table: `business_id` foreign key

### 2. Updated unique constraints:
- Coupon codes: unique per business (not global)
- Ranking levels: unique per business (not global)
- Admin can only manage their business

### 3. API Controllers Updates Needed:
- Filter all queries by `req.admin.businessId`
- Create records with admin's `businessId`
- Prevent cross-business data access

## Flutter App Impact:

### Current Flutter App:
- Fetches global theme colors
- Shows global rankings
- Uses global coupons

### Required Flutter Changes:
- Add business selection/detection
- Fetch business-specific colors
- Show business-specific rankings
- Use business-specific coupons

## Registration Flow:

### Option 1: Business Registration First
1. Admin creates business account
2. Gets unique business code
3. Customers enter business code in app
4. App loads that business's colors/rankings

### Option 2: Business Code in App
1. Customer enters business code
2. App loads business-specific theme
3. Shows business-specific loyalty program

## Next Steps:

1. **Finish backend controller updates** (in progress)
2. **Update Flutter app** to be business-aware
3. **Add business registration flow**
4. **Test multi-tenant functionality**

This is a CRITICAL architectural change that affects the entire system!
